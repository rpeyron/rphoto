Description: RPhoto is is small software aiming at the easy handling of digital camera's photos. Its origin resides in the lack of a simple software capable of cropping photos with a constant ratio, to avoid white borders when printing. Main features are :
 * Crop images with a constant width / height ratio (by example 4:3 for numeric photos)
 * Rotate / Flip photos
 * Lossless crop / rotate / flip operations.
 * Comment editing
 * Exif visualization
