  summary: easy handling of digital camera's photos.
  description: |
    RPhoto is a small software aiming at the easy handling of digital camera's photos. (RPhoto 
    is the next generation of IMPhoto). Its origin resides in the lack of a simple software 
    capable of cropping photos with a constant ratio, to avoid white borders when printing.
